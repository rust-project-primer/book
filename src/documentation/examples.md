# Examples

There are some things that I consider to be part of _documentation_ even though
technically, they are not documentation. These are _unit tests_ and _examples_.

title: Add examples to your Rust libraries

Karol explains the need for working examples when using an unfamiliar
library, and how Rust supports this out-of-the-box with its support for
examples. Karol explains that Rust treats examples as documentation, and builds
them when you run `cargo test`. Karol argues that all Rust projects should come
with good examples, because they make using the code easier and help people get
started.
