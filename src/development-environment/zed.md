# Zed

[Zed][zed] is a code editor that comes with support for Rust out-of-the-box. It
deserves a special mention because it itself is written in Rust. It is fairly
minimalist, offering limited support for extensions (only themes, grammars and
language servers can be extended). But the advantage is that it requires no
setup, it understands and can work on Rust projects with no configuration.

If you just want an editor that you can use to write Rust code, and you only
need features that `rust-analyzer` comes with out of the box, then it is a good
choice. It is also [open-source][].
