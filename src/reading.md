# Reading

This guide is not intended to cover the fundamentals of the Rust programming
language. Instead, it focuses on sharing practical insights and strategies that
I've found valuable in scaling Rust projects and maintaining high quality. For
those new to Rust or in need of a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend
starting with foundational books on the language. These books delve into Rust's
concepts in greater depth than this guide aims to.

## Books

Below is a list of essential readings for grasping the intricacies of Rust.
Throughout this guide, where relevant, I will provide links to specific
chapters from these books. This will enable you to explore topics more
thoroughly and deepen your understanding as needed.

Some people in the Rust community have written articles and guides with a
similar scope as this book. While some of the takes may be different from those
presented in this book, it can be valuable to review these to see which conclusions
others in the Rust community have arrived at.
