# Introduction

I'm putting this guide out there, permissively licensed under the *CC BY-NC-SA
4.0* license. There are no advertisements or subscriptions, nor do I charge a
fee for reading this book.

In some ways, writing this guide is my way of giving back to the Rust community,
which has given me the tools to write code joyfully. If you want to give something
back, I suggest you get involved in the community, for example:

- Helping with the [Rust compiler development][rustc], [RFC process][rfc] or
  joining a [workgroup][governance],
- Helping the Rust [crate ecosystem][crates], by participating in building
  features or fixing bugs,
- Sharing your knowledge through blog posts, guides or tutorials.

[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs
[governance]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance
[crates]: https://crates.io

If you are new to the Rust programming language, I recommend you to spend some
time writing documentation for Rust crates that need it. It is a good way to be
exposed to some Rust code and make an impact, and documentation is usually
appreciated and uncontroversial.

## Target Audience

This book is aimed at anyone who wants to start, maintain or collaborate on Rust
software projects.

You can read this book at several levels. If you are a very technical person
with a lot of project experience, you can use this as a recipe book showing you
examples of how to implement various practises in real-world Rust projects. If
you are less technical, but want to understand what is possible in terms of
automation that can lead to higher quality code and save development time, you
can use this book as an overview various strategies and what they accomplish.

Although the focus is specifically on Rust software projects, some of the
information contained in this book is also useful for software projects in
general. It covers various good practises of software development, containing
insights from various companies and successful projects.

## How to read this book

This book is structured like a recipe book: you can read it cover-to-cover,
if you like. But you can also use it as a tool to look up recipes for how
to solve issues you might run across.
