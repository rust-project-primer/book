# Introduction

- software becomes ever more complex
- rust is very promising, it has language features that allow you to manage complexity
- yet, maintaining software projects is more than just writing good code
- software projects need to be structured in a way that allows them to grow
- the rust language ecosystem has an extraordinary amount of tooling that allows you to automate this
- best practises from 30 years of software development are encoded in the tooling of the rust language
- this book teaches you how to take advantage of that
- this book shows you how you can keep your rust projects free of bugs and usable by others with less effort
- this book is a recipe book, every chapter is self-contained
- you should not implement every piece of advice from this book, rather use it as inspiration

While the Rust programming language is amazing, this is not a book about Rust,
per se. Instead, this book gives little nuggets of information on how you can
structure and maintain Rust software projects. As such, it focusses not on the
Rust language, but rather on the way that you can use it effectively.

## Target Audience

This book is aimed at anyone who wants to start, maintain or collaborate on Rust
software projects.

You can read this book at several levels. If you are a very technical person
with a lot of project experience, you can use this as a recipe book showing you
examples of how to implement various practises in real-world Rust projects. If
you are less technical, but want to understand what is possible in terms of
automation that can lead to higher quality code and save development time, you
can use this book as an overview various strategies and what they accomplish.

Although the focus is specifically on Rust software projects, some of the
information contained in this book is also useful for software projects in
general. It covers various good practises of software development, containing
insights from various companies and successful projects.

## How to read this book

This book is structured like a recipe book: you can read it cover-to-cover,
if you like. But you can also use it as a tool to look up recipes for how
to solve issues you might run across.
