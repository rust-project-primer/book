# Buck2

> Buck2 is an extensible and performant build system written in Rust and

It is written and maintained by Facebook, and is very similar to Bazel. What
makes it interesting is that it is written in Rust, which makes it rather
likely that it has good support for building Rust projects.

I don't have any experience with it, and I also do not know how well it
integrates with other languages. I merely wanted to mention it here, because
it is likely that it is a good candidate for a build system that allows
mixing and matching multiple languages, similar to Bazel.
