# Platform



Code is not written in a vacuum, rather it is written in collaboration with
others. But perhaps more importantly, modern software development attempts to
automate as much as possible in the development workflow. This is where CI systems
are used.

Besides just storing code, the requirements are:

- Allowing collaboration with other, such as by making change suggestions, code
  review, 

CI systems are an indispensable part of modern software engineering, because they
allow you to offload the enforcement of good coding practises to a machine. 

This guide recommends using [GitHub][github] or [GitLab][gitlab] as development
platforms with their respective CI pipelines.

Where possible, in this guide examples for how to integrate tools and checks with
these platforms are shown.
