# Meson

Meson is a bit of an oddball to include here. It does not offer any of the
interesting features that other build systems do, for example the ability to
easily cache build artifacts.

The reason I am including it here is because it has some features that make it
useful for the niche use-case of building GTK or FlatPak applications, which it
has built-in support for. This is why you see a lot of GNOME developers that use
Rust use it as their primary build system.
