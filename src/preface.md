I wrote this book as a guide for how to bootstrap, structure and maintain Rust
projects out of a passion for the Rust programming language. Having accumulated
some opinions on what allows projects to succeed, I feel that it is valuable to
share what I have learned.

You should not view this as a definitive guide, but rather as a collection of
nuggets of advice that come with rationale and examples. Not every piece of
advice may apply to your project, and you might have different opinions than I
have.  Whether you agree with the advice I give in this book or not, I hope
that you can draw some benefit from it and find useful patterns.

The Rust programming language is a lot younger than some of the programming
languages you have worked with in the past. It also has a development velocity
that is faster than you are used to. You may find that some pieces of advice
become outdated over time. I do my best to try to update this book when I can,
but you should feel free to do your own research.

If you find something in this book that is ourageously wrong, feel free to
create a [merge request][repo] with your suggestion, I am happy to take a look
at it.

This book is a living document, not a finished product. It will be periodically
updated with new insights and revised examples, reflecting ongoing learnings in
the field of Rust programming.
