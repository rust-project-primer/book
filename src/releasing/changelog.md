# Changelog

When it comes to creating releases, an important aspect of doing so is
communicating the changes that have occured in the new version. This is true
regardless of whether your Rust project is a library or whether it is a product.

In the open-source world, this is typically done using a _changelog_, which is
typically simply a file checked into the repository that keeps a list of the
important changes for downstream users of the software for every version that is
released.

they are useful.
