## License

I'm licensing this book under the *CC BY-NC-SA 4.0* license. Licensing it this
way gives you a lot of freedom to adapt this book and update it, as long as you
do not do so for commercial gain. I hope that it will be useful to some, 

If you want to give something back to the Rust community, I suggest you get
involved in the community, for example:

- Helping with the [Rust compiler development][rustc], [RFC process][rfc] or
  joining a [workgroup][governance],
- Helping the Rust [crate ecosystem][crates], by participating in building
  features or fixing bugs,
- Sharing your knowledge through blog posts, guides or tutorials.

[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs
[governance]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance
[crates]: https://crates.io

If you are new to the Rust programming language, I recommend you to spend some
time writing documentation for Rust crates that need it. It is a good way to be
exposed to some Rust code and make an impact. Adding good documentation is
usually appreciated and uncontroversial.
