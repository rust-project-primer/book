# Ecosystem

Before you start your project, you may need to put some throughts towards what
kind of project you want to build, and choose the right ecosystem. Rust has a
vibrant community of all kinds of projects, usually over time certain crates
become more popular and establish themselves as the go-to. It is usually better
to put some thought into this before you start developing, because it might be
difficult to switch once you've already invested in building your project with
one ecosystem.
