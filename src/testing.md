# Testing

In my opinion, all of the software that I love using has one thing in common:
it is thoroughly and carefully tested.

Rust recognizes the importance of testing, and as such has several facilities
built-in for writing unit tests as part of the code base.

Some people like using `cargo-nextest` instead of the built-in `cargo test`
for running unit tests.
