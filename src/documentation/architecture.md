# Architecture

If you do not have enough time to write proper documentation, this is fine.
However, I would argue that the one thing you should always provide is a
high-level architecture diagram.

[ARCHITECTURE.md](https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html) by Alex Kladov

*Alex argues in this article for adding a file named `ARCHITECTURE.md` into
software repositories to document the architecture of the code base. He argues
that writing good documentation is hard, and it is not often done. But some
someone starting to work in an unfamiliar codebase, such a document with a
bird's-eye view of the layout of the project is invaluable.*

*ADRs are a tool to record the reasoning behind architecture changes.*
