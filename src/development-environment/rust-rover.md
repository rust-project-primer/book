# RustRover

[RustRover][rustrover] is a commercial IDE offered by JetBrains. It has a deeper integration and
more intelligent features than the other IDEs listed here, but is only free for personal use.

It is being actively developed, and new features that make writing Rust code and managing Rust
projects are constantly added. The advantage is that it is all integrated and works out-of-the-box,
unlike Visual Studio Code which needs some custom plugins that achieve what it can do.

The only downside of it is that it is commercial, meaning that it is not open-source.
