- personal history with languages

I wrote this book as a guide for how to bootstrap, structure and maintain Rust
projects out of a passion for the Rust programming language. Having accumulated
some opinions on what allows projects to succeed, I feel that it is valuable to
share what I have learned.

You should not view this as a definitive guide, but rather as a collection of
nuggets of advice that come with rationale and examples. Not every piece of
advice may apply to your project, and you might have different opinions than I
have.  Whether you agree with the advice I give in this book or not, I hope
that you can draw some benefit from it and find useful patterns.

The Rust programming language is a lot younger than some of the programming
languages you have worked with in the past. It also has a development velocity
that is faster than you are used to. You may find that some pieces of advice
become outdated over time. I do my best to try to update this book when I can,
but you should feel free to do your own research.

If you find something in this book that is ourageously wrong, feel free to
create a [merge request][repo] with your suggestion, I am happy to take a look
at it.

This book is a living document, not a finished product. It will be periodically
updated with new insights and revised examples, reflecting ongoing learnings in
the field of Rust programming.

## License

I'm putting this guide out there, permissively licensed under the *CC BY-NC-SA
4.0* license. There are no advertisements or subscriptions, nor do I charge a
fee for reading this book.

In some ways, writing this guide is my way of giving back to the Rust community,
which has given me the tools to write code joyfully. If you want to give something
back, I suggest you get involved in the community, for example:

- Helping with the [Rust compiler development][rustc], [RFC process][rfc] or
  joining a [workgroup][governance],
- Helping the Rust [crate ecosystem][crates], by participating in building
  features or fixing bugs,
- Sharing your knowledge through blog posts, guides or tutorials.

[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs
[governance]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance
[crates]: https://crates.io

If you are new to the Rust programming language, I recommend you to spend some
time writing documentation for Rust crates that need it. It is a good way to be
exposed to some Rust code and make an impact, and documentation is usually
appreciated and uncontroversial.
