# Nix

While originally a package management and declarative system configuration
tool, through it's focus on being fully reproducible, Nix has become a popular
tool for reproducible builds and deployments.

Nix is quite versatile. It can be used to configure your system, setup a
hygienic development shell containing only the dependencies you explicitly
requested, build Docker images with the minimal set of runtime dependencies.
