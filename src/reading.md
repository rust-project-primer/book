# Recommended Reading

This guide does not explain the fundamentals of the Rust programming language.
Rather, it shows some practical things that I have found to be useful to do in
Rust projects to allow them to scale and be of high quality.

Before reading this guide, if you have not already, I highly recommend reading
some books that give you a vast understanding of the Rust programming language
and explain concepts in much more detail than I ever could.

Here is a few books which I consider to be essential for understanding Rust.
Where possible, I will link to relevant chapters in these books from within
this guide, so that you may read about topics more in-depth.
